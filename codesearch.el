;; Description:
;;
;; This extension allows you to use the codesearch code indexing
;; system in emacs.
;;
;; For more details, see the project page at
;; https://github.com/abingham/codesearch.el.
;;
;; For more details on codesearch, see its project page at

;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; The simple way is to use package.el:
;;
;;   M-x package-install codesearch
;;
;; Or, copy codesearch.el to some location in your emacs load
;; path. Then add "(require 'codesearch)" to your emacs initialization
;; (.emacs, init.el, or something).
;;
;; Example config:
;;
;;   (require 'codesearch)
;;
;; This elisp extension assumes you've got the codesearch tools -
;; csearch and cindex - installed. See the codesearch-csearch and
;; codesearch-cindex variables for more information.
